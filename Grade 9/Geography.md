>> **```Absolute location```**: A location described in terms of ```longtitude``` and ```latitude```.   
>> **```Relative location```**: A location described by in terms of its surronding features.

> ## Geotechnologies
>> ```GPS```: **G**lobal **P**ositioning **S**ystem    
>>> They tell us where we are   

>> ```GIS```: **G**eographic **I**nformation **S**ystem   
>>> This technology is used to help geographers to anaylze an area of land   

>> ```Telematics```: The branch of information technology which deals with the long-distance transmission of computerized information.    
>>> This technology helps us to communicate between long distances

>> ```Remote Sensing```: The scanning of the earth by satellite or high-flying aircraft in order to obtain information about it.     
>>> This technology helps us scan an area of land from a satellite

> ## Geographic concepts:
>> ```Interrelationships```: a relationship that exists betweeen different pattern and trends.
>>> Example: ```The mountain pine beetle is damaging the pine trees, we should are because our ecosystem and economics are also being damaged```

>> ```Spatial Significance```: The importance of something's location
>>> Example: ```Why are the pine beetles there? Due to climate change, they are surviving through the winter```
 
>>```Patterns nad Trends```: A recurring thing or change
>>> Example: ```Why things are there and why the matter```

>> ```Geographic Perspective```: A geographic way of looking at the world
>>> Example: ``` Geographers think about the ecosystem and the landscape while other people just regard them as mountains or rivers```

> ## Theory of Continental Drift
>> Plates move due to hot magma below it moving it   
>> It was theorized by German scientist ```Alfred Wagner```   

>> ### Alfred Wegner's Theory:

>> |Proof #|Description|
>> |:------|:----------|
>> |1. The Jigsaw Fit|He saw the jigsaw fit between South America and Africa, meaning they must have been together at some point|
>> |2. Fossils|He found fossils of the same plants and animals on both continents, therefore it could've only happened if those continents were once part of the same land mass or joined together at some point|
>> |3. The Mountains|The Mountains ```(Appalachians, Caledonian and Scandinavia )``` are similar in age and structure on both side of the atlantic ocean, therefore the mountains was made due to 2 of the continents when they collided|
>> |4. Ice Sheets|Ice sheets were found in warm places, therefore the hypothesis is that these places were closer to the south pole at some point|

> ## Chinas *former* One Child Policy
>> China only allowed ```one child``` per family, this was used to ```control the population```    
>> The result of this was way too many ```boys``` as families wanted boys because they would stay with them and carry on their family name

> ## Demographic Transition Model (DTM)
>> - The development of agriculture     
>> - The transition from rural to urban residence    
>> - An increased awareness of disease prevention and cures     
>> - Change in the societal role of females     
>> - Changes in preferred family size     

>> ### Stages

>> 1. **Pre-Transition**
>>    - Both birth and death rates are ```high```
>>       - Woman have ```6 to 10``` children on average
>>       - Most children die before adulthood
>>    - The population does not grow/grows ```minimally```
>>    - **```No country is currently in this stage```**
>>    - Food is ```hunted``` and ```gathered```
>>    - Very ```basic forms``` of agriculture
>>    - Life is ```harsh and uncertain```
>>    - ```Diseases are very common and deadly```
>>    - Most people die from ```disease```, ```poor nutrition```, or ```contaminated drinking water```

>> 2. **Early Transition**
>>    - Birth rates are ```high```, death rate drops ```dramatically```
>>    - ```Population explosion```
>>    - ```Very few countries``` are in this stage
>>        - Examples: ```Chad, Niger```
>>    - ```Agriculture``` is very common
>>    - Commercial food production ```increases```
>>    - ```Less diseases``` due to simple sanitation improvements
>>    - People begin ```migrating``` to ```urban``` areas
>>    - Large families persist, but less children die

>> 3. **Late Transition**
>>    - Birth rate ```drops quickly```, death rate drops further
>>    - ```Small families``` are becoming the norm
>>    - The ```natural increase``` rate (in population) drops
>>    - Most people live in ```urban``` areas
>>    - ```Mechanization```, especially in ```agriculture```

>> 4. **Post Transition**
>>    - Birth rate and death rate ```stabilize``` to around the same level
>>      - However the ```replacement rate``` (number of births per woman that result in a stable population, is usually ```2:1```) is ```dramtically declining```
>>      - Alot of the population is ```graying```
>>    - More than ```80%``` of the population is urban
>>    - Woman work ```full-time``` jobs similarly to men

> ## Push and Pull Factors

>> **```Push Factor```**: A reason that encourages people to move away from their current country
>>   - Examples: ```Undesired climate, threat of war, economic problems, poor environmental conditions```

>> **```Pull Factor```**: A reason that makes particular country seem attractive to potential immigrants
>>   - Examples: ```Economic opportunities, political stability, freedom, residental friends and family```

> ## Type of Immigrants

>> ### Permanent

>> |Type|Description|
>> |:---|:----------|
>> |**Skilled Worker Class**|- Judged using a point system. To be admitted into the country, they need a minimum number of points<br>- This point assessment is done for the family member with the highest point total<br>- If one person qualifies, whole family is let in<br>- Government has identified high-demand occupations like engineers, doctors, nurses etc.|
>> |**Skilled Trades Class**|- Attracts immigrants with specific trade skills that are in short supply in Canada (i.e. electricians, plumbers, machinists, mine workers)<br>- This is a “pass or fail” system rather than a point system<br>- Person must meet 4 requirements:<br>- Have a job offer in Canada<br>- Have strong enough language skills to do the job<br>- Have two or more years of experience in the trade<br>- Be qualified to do the job by Canadian standards|
>> |**Canadian Exprience Class**|- Accepts immigrants who have legally worked in Canada under a temporary worker program for at least one year<br>- Pass or fail system, applicant does **NOT** require a job offer in Canada|

>> ### Temporary & Humanitarian

>> |Type|Description|
>> |:---|:----------|
>> |**Temporary Foreign Worker Program**|- Fill Labour Shortages<br>- Extraordinary talents: enhance economy<br>- Some immigrate after the end of their contract as “Canadian Experience Class"<br>- Most return home after the end of their work VISA<br>- Controversial|
>> |**Family Class**|- Allows families of Canadian citizens to reunite in Canada<br>- these immigrants must be sponsored by a family member living in Canada that is at least 18 years of age<br>- the sponsor must agree to provide housing and financial needs for the new immigrant for 3-10 years if they run into financial difficulty|
>> |**Refugees**|- A refugee is someone who fears persecution (or even death) in their home country <br>- this persecution must be for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or political opinion<br>- approximately 30 000 refugees are allowed into Canada every year<br>- a refugee would not be required to take the point system test|


>> **```Rule```**: In canada, ```Economic immigrants``` need **minimum 67 Points** to be considered in Canada
